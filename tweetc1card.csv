6332,2022-11-15 13:27:36+00:00,megansrep,@LifewithKrystle wait list means you typically can‚Äôt participate in verified fan presale. you can join the capital one presale but if you don‚Äôt have the card then you‚Äôll have to wait for general admission. i have had instances where i‚Äôve been waitlisted and got a code a few weeks later tho!

6349,2022-11-15 13:00:18+00:00,catsandcursing,@dr_seminnis If you have a Capital One card you can get a presale code separately. Actually I think its the first 5-6 digits of your card.
